## Java Project - Hangman
This project is a game of Hangman and was made using Java. The aim of the project was to demonstrate my understanding of the four pillars of OOP.

## Project Goals
1. **Create a Working Game** The main task is to create a Hangman game; testing your understanding of Java and OOP (Object Orientated Programming) and how to break down a problem.
2. **Practice Using Git and GitHub Flow** This project gives the opportunity to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line through IntelliJ.
3. **Application of Learning** Apply what you have been learning on course so far with the focus on Java. This project should be broken down into a number of classes with their own role which interact with each other.
